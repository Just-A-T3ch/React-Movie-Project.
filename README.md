In the context of this movie application project, I employed a variety of features within React, including the useState and useEffect hooks, as well as API integration to fetch and display data from a real-world API. Furthermore, I delved into advanced concepts such as context, JSX, conditional rendering, the configuration of React Router DOM, error handling, loading states, and additional relevant topics.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
